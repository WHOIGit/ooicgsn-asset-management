Because the input filename is specified, the extension can be anything;
log, cap, txt, LOL

Sometimes, but not all the time, two different sets of C,P,T calibration pdfs are received from the vendor after refurb. The earlier-dated set is the "as-received" post-calibration and the later-dated set is the calibration after refurb. The latter one should be used to make the csv calfile.

Additional vendor documentation that may be present, but can be ignored: *.con files.
